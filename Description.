Using Google Drive, we are making a movie store app similar to Assignments 6, 7, and 12. But instead of Assignmetns 6 and 7 being BST, 
we have built them as Hash Tables. It will have functions and nested functions. they will be using a .txt file of which is supplied by us. 
It will start off with a Main Menu  function, the user then inputs their chioce as a corrosponding number in the menu, each option has a 
particular algorythm, some have sub menus that are then called up with more options, there operate the same as the Main Menu.  For 
example, the main menu will give options to insert a movie ,delete a movie , rent a movie, or print the inentory, if the find option is 
selectes in the main menu, there will be a sub-menu called to give a more defined criteria to search for the inventory. 

KEYDEL IS NO LONGER IN TH GROUP< HE BELONGS TO ANOTHER RECITATION SECTION.  

THIS PROJECT IS MADE BY BJORLOW AND MOONEY.
