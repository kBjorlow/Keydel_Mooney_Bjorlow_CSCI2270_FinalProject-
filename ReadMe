Project Summary:
	Did you ever rent movies from Blockbuster in the 1990’s? We have an App to bring the 90’s back to you like they were yesterday! 
	This app is made to relive the renting experience that we all lived as children.  This app allows the user to insert a movie into 
	the inventory of movies, delete a movie from the inventory (almost as they were the manager of the blockbuster), find the movie 
	within the inventory, or print the inventory. When the user selects a specific option in the Main Menu, each option would run a 
	specific algorithm, some options would bring up a secondary menu with more options for the user to pick from. For example, the Find 
	option has a sub-menu, this sub menu brings options to search the inventory by genre, rank, name or to return to the Main Menu. 
	Throughout the program you can alter the inventory to the users liking.  Then as a normal customer they can rent a movie, or anything 
	else.

How to Run:
	When the app is open, there will be a Main Menu displayed, the user will enter in the desired option as the corresponding number, 
	and only the number, for example, the menu option would look like this "2. Search by name", the user would enter in a “2”. The next 
	automatic output from the program would be something where the user enters in a word, or a phrase like a movie title, or single word 
	answer. For example the program would output something like "Enter Rank:" then the user would enter something like “8”, or the 
	program would output "Enter title:" and the user would input something like ”Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens”. The user would 
	continue processes like these until they are finished and select the “Quit” option.


Dependencies:
	
	There are no dependencies except a text file which is provided for you. 


System Requirements:
	
	The program can be accessed through terminal, or through another C++ code running application of chosen. It will run on all computer 
	systems, Mac, Linux, windows or anything else.

Open issues/Bugs:
•	When adding a movie, rank occasionally doubles, example, there are two movies under rank 51
•	Characters other than numbers when asked for a year when inserting a movie breaks the application.
•	Really large integers break the application, remember this is a 1990 computer, it isn’t as smart as you and I.
